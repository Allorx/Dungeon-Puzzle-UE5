A rubiks cube like game with turn based strategy in Unreal Engine - can run on UE5 (tested with 5.0)

- A 3D turn based strategy game I was working on, on a rubiks cube. The core mechanics are complete but the game is unfinished.
- The rubiks cube can be created to be any shape/size/dimensions; the cubes will always rotate around the world center.
- BP can be attached to any cube and movement between cubes is also implemented on any Object_A class.
- Design documentation is also attached for understanding the structure of the classes and easy development.
- The visual assets are placeholders.
